# 🥑 Avocado Ripeness Predictor

This project uses a machine learning model (RandomForestClassifier) to predict the **ripeness stage** of avocados based on various physical properties. It classifies avocados as one of the following:

- **Ripe**
- **Hard**
- **Breaking**
- **Pre-conditioned**

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Predict the ripeness of an avocado based on features like firmness, hue, and more.
- **Model Used:** `RandomForestClassifier` from Scikit-learn.
- **Dataset:** Contains avocado samples with labeled ripeness and measured properties.

## 📁 Dataset Features

The dataset includes the following features (from `avocado_ripeness_dataset.csv`):

- `firmness`
- `hue`
- `elasticity`
- `acoustic_resonance`
- `temperature`  
- `ripeness` *(target label)*

> 📌 You can explore and modify the dataset to improve the model performance or include more real-world data.

## 🧠 Model Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning** – Handle missing values, type conversions.
2. **Feature Selection** – Use features like firmness, hue, etc.
3. **Model Training** – Using `RandomForestClassifier`.
4. **Evaluation** – Accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics.
5. **Prediction** – Predict ripeness of a new avocado based on input properties.

## 📊 Results

- Achieved high accuracy using ensemble methods.
- The model shows strong generalization across different ripeness levels.

## 🔧 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/avocado-ripeness-predictor.git
   cd avocado-ripeness-predictor
   ```

2. Install requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook avacado_ripness.ipynb
   ```

4. Try out predictions by modifying input in the test cell.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
